    <p>the first few times I made the journey over land (and sea) between Ireland, where I&rsquo;m from, and Belgium, where I live, I felt almost embarrassed telling people. it felt like a ridiculously long journey, and a lot of money to spend on it too, when there are such cheap flights between those places. I felt self-conscious about my decision to travel by land for environmental reasons, even though I knew it was justified and a perfectly innocuous decision that didn&rsquo;t affect anyone else, simply because air travel, especially for Irish people wanting to get off our little island, is such a norm. I thought people might think I was some kind of climate martyr trying to make them feel bad for taking planes</p>

    <p>making that first journey, I thought, ok, this isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;m going to be able to do every time, but why not do it now, I have the time, and it&rsquo;s a kind of dramatic way to move country. but four years later, I now make the majority of my journeys between Ireland and Belgium by land. Last Christmas, last Easter, in June for a wedding, to Scotland in July for a holiday and then to Dublin from there, this time for work. I have flown this year too. once from Brussels to Dublin in March for an interview, because I had to book last minute and couldn&rsquo;t afford the Eurostar, and again from Dublin to Brussels in August, travelling with a group of participants for a film project. I still feel guilty when I fly. rather than working on not feeling guilty, which is what other people (read: my parents) tell me to do, I see that guilt as being symptomatic of a gap between what I want to be doing and what I am doing, and want to work on reducing the gap as much as I can. which, as I start to work increasingly often in Ireland, is going to mean asking to have my over-land travel costs (and potentially travel time) covered by project money, which I have occasionally been successful in. it helps that I have, over time, normalised it even just for myself</p>

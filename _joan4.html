    <p>if you fly you bypass the landscape in between the place you are at the beginning and the destination</p>
    <p>for a long time the idea of ‘slowing down’ did not appeal to me. I liked going fast, getting lots of stimuli, feeling I was doing something, contributing something. In fact for many years, in which I taught drama and worked multiple side jobs between and alongside unpaid and underpaid creative projects to be able to pay my rent, I was fueled by an antsiness connected to wanting to do more, in terms of creative work, not less. earlier this year though my body took the executive decision to slow down. I developed hypothyroidism, likely triggered by ongoing high cortisol levels. the thyroid works hormonally, and basically regulates a lot of functions of your body, from energy levels to sleep to digestion. the main symptom I was experiencing was fatigue, on a level I had never experienced before. there were days when I could hardly get out of bed, which, as someone who used to move around very fast and do a lot of things in one day, was also mentally hard to deal with

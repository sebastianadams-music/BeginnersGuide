<p> We are asking that anybody who knows the early history of the Sail and Rail tickets comes forward to let us know.</p>
<p class="right">In Britain and Ireland, a SailRail ticket allows travel with a combination of train and ferry. The brand, which was in existence by 2005, is principally associated with rail tickets between National Rail stations in Great Britain and stations in Ireland, including ferry travel on one of three routes across the Irish Sea.
<br><br>
The fare for the ticket is fixed, and can still be affordable even if purchased on the day of travel, unlike most airline tickets.
    <br><br>
    The SailRail brand name was in use by 2005, at which time it was described as "an alliance of UK Train operating companies and ferry companies operating on the Irish Sea" and providing an "alternative to budget airline travel".

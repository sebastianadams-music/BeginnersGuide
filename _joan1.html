    <p>god I find it hard enough to reply to emails on the SailRail, let alone make art</p>

    <p>funny how much energy &amp; attention goes to all the other people (it&rsquo;s almost always a lot of people when I&rsquo;m going this direction), even when you don&rsquo;t want it to</p>
    
    <p>I suppose it&rsquo;s an interesting&#8230;soundscape</p>

    <p class="right">&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is possible to contribute to the present moment in any meaningful way while being wholly engulfed by it. It is only by stepping out of it, by taking a telescopic perspective, that we can then dip back in and do the work which our times asks of us.&rsquo; <br>-Maria Popova</p>

    <p>when you travel slower, you encounter more. <br>because there&rsquo;s just more time to. I rarely talk to people on planes, but I often do, even if it&rsquo;s just a short chat, on the SailRail. <br>and there are more parts of the journey where you have an opportunity for conversation too</p>
    
    <p>there&rsquo;s also the bonding that happens when there are cancellations or delays &amp; you find yourself allied, at least in a small way, to strangers trying to travel to the same place. I suppose that happens with planes too, but it&rsquo;s a bit different. with the SailRail it&rsquo;s a more active figuring things out together, helping each other. which train to get, which station to change at, what time the ferry after the one we&rsquo;re going to miss is at&#8230;</p>
    
    

    <p class="right">&lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s important to practice new forms of movement in the Anthropocene, in order to encounter climate change on the ecosystem&rsquo;s terms (...). You are caught up in the flows, move at the same speed as the trash and algae and seaweed around you. And it makes me wonder, how do we normally move through the world in ways that limit, or prohibit the world from entering us?&rsquo; -Angela Sakrison, Rowboat Phenomenology</p>

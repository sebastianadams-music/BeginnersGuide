    <p>the more times I made the journey, the less special it became. it also became less long, less slow. or so it seemed. my perception shifted. I didn&rsquo;t think about the work I could get done in the extra time needed to travel by train and ferry instead of by plane. I didn&rsquo;t think about what a lovely time I would have gazing out at the scenery and reflecting on my life while on the train (sometimes I do, but it&rsquo;s not a given). it&rsquo;s just become a habit, not something I am doing to prove a point or be virtuous. it is my auto-pilot way to move between my two homes (pun intended)</p>

    <h3>Blink Piece - Jane Hackett</h3>
    <p>Find a mirror and stand in front of it. <br>
        Look at yourself. Have a staring competition with yourself. <br>
        Whoever blinks first must create a rhythmic pattern with their eye blinks. <br>
        Donâ€™t pre-empt the rhythm. Listen to your surroundings for inspiration. <br>
        Play with the contrast of blinks. <br>
        When the time is right, rest your eyes and notice what you see in the darkness.

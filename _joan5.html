    <p>even after starting to implement recommendations of multiple doctors, and slowly feeling my energy levels rise somewhat, I decided that regardless of whether my hypothyroidism proved to be chronic or not, I wanted to try to do less. or maybe not less exactly, but do more on less projects. because over the years I had come to appreciate that, in art as in other aspects of life, doing nothing in not doing nothing. just as silence is not real silence. in my practice, what looks like doing less is not actually doing less. It took me some experience to realise how important those days in the studio where, apart from boiling the kettle, you spend the whole day staring at the wall or out the window, thinking. doing less is simply a different approach, and one that sometimes allows me to make more, or something that IS more. so when Sebastian invited me to work on this project, while I was initially excited at the prospect, I did doubt saying yes at first, and had to have a good think about whether it was a good idea to commit to an additional project, after having decided to focus in the coming year more on my own personal practice, and commit less energy than in previous years to other collective projects on top of that. In the end I decided that this project would give as much energy as it would take, and that I also just wanted more improvisation in my life, which I knew would be central to our process with the piece. my tiredness is making me be more unapologetic about choosing creative work over admin and planning and networking work connected to the creative work. my body is rejecting the admin, and wanting instead to sink into the moving, drawing, writing. I know that the admin side of the work is necessary, but it’s not what I want to be absorbed by right now. maybe I need to find a new way to do it. when I was starting out as a theatre maker, a lot of my energy went into writing applications, sending emails, trying to meet and connect with relevant people, coming up with proposals that would never happen, because I felt that was what I needed to do in order for someone to let me make the work. now that my energy levels are so quickly depleted it has become even more clear that I am not happy about the energy I put into my practice is divided. slash consumed. yes, emails need to be answered, but if you don’t make time for creating, no one is going to make it for you. granted it is partly thanks to many years of legwork setting up projects without money and connecting with people that I did do back when I had the energy for it, and some recent focused periods applying for funding, that I am now in a position to carve out more time to just be in the studio, messing around. and more time to do nothing. and to read. so of course I also read ‘How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy,’ by Jenny Odell. which funnily enough is also about how doing nothing is not actually doing nothing. the book could be described as being about shifting our attention, and doing less in one framework (corporate social media for example), to do more in another, for example a birdwatching group in a local park or a neighbourhood Signal group:

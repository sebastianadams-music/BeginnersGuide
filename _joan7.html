<p>part of why I wanted to be an artist was the idea that, in art, there are rules, kind of, but you can also break them, or make your own rules, and that’s also kind of what it’s all about. I liked the idea of making and testing new rules or conditions for being in the world and interacting with each other, under the guise of performance. as I see it, we made the piece, and the process of making it (and travelling to rehearsals), a kind of micro-habitat for living and working differently in. and like me taking the SailRail, what begins as some kind of symbolic statement or artistic gesture neither practical or normal, once you start in-habiting it, can become just that - a habit for living in, too.</p>
